# The interface/host to bind the ABCI port to. On Docker you probably want
# this to be 0.0.0.0, so that you can use a bridge network to NAT to it
# from the host. This will allow CometBFT in a separate Docker container
# to be able to access tcp://felidae:26658 as its proxyapp.
#
# Just be sure to not allow direct access to this port from the outside world!
# We bind the Docker NAT side to 127.0.0.1 for this reason.
